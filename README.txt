Welcome to SkrillexBans V1.3

Every other plugin, that involves with banning them after death A.K.A Deathbans, have either stopped being developed, was either too
complicated to setup, or had certain issues that refrained from working.

This is where SkrillexBans comes in, the name may sound wierd due to my favorite genre, Dubstep.. What's funny is I'm not a big Skrillex Fanboy at all.

Enough of that, SkrillexBans is a simpler, actively developed DeathBans alternative that can be used for your future Minecraft server.

It has:
- Working bans system, bans the player after their death.
- Customized messages in the configuration*
- Customize the death penalty.*
- Log player's IP after login, to prevent multiple accounts** (Configurable Option to enable it*)

**I would recommend running this plugin along with RangeBans or other IP Banning plugin for best use of this feature

*Not yet developed.
